# About Me

My name is Mariana Estrada and I am second-year MURP student concentrating in Design & Development. I grew up in Boyle Heights and later moved to a small city in the Inland Empire called Perris. Both these places have special places in my heart and have significantly informed the way I approach planning.

On my free time I like to chill at the park (usually Vista Hermosa) with family and friends. I  like to be creative so I try to draw, color, or do some designs on my iPad or laptop whenever I can. I'm also currently working towards the Urban Humanities certificate which aims to train students in intigrating additional layers of data that would be typically left out of traditional maps. Below is a picture of a map I am working on for a UH project:

# About 221

This course will: 
- Demonstrate the value of data for planning purposes through discovery, exploration, and analysis
- Critically evaluate data and create frameworks to prepare data for research
- Apply data science programming techniques to produce relevant visualizations that inform urban policy
- Learn to visualize data spatially to communicate the importance of place-based informatics
- Learn to produce publication-ready scholarly materials in the form of tables, charts, and maps

# Project Ideas

I plan on producing  maps that show various aspects of the built environment (such as tree canopy and water access points) of Skid Row that make unhoused residents vulnerale to heat.

# Objective for the Course

I hope to learn Ptython so I can use it to create maps and clean, analyze, and maniulate data. I also hope to use Python in ESRI ArcGIS so I can analyze large databases instead of using geoprocesing tools that can take long.
